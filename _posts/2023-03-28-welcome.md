Hell All,

Welcome to my blog.

I Raj Gohil, Speech Processing researcher will be starting a series of blogs by which I will be sharing the knowledge of Speech Recognition, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Toolkits

I will also be doing the overview of various top conferences like ICASSP, Interspeech, ICLR, ICML, MLSP and others which will help to stay updated with the recent trends in the field.

If you guys want me to share any more things do comment below.

Please share with you friends.
